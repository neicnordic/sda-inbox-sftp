# SFTP Inbox for NeIC SDA

![Java CI](https://github.com/neicnordic/sda-inbox-sftp/workflows/Java%20CI/badge.svg)

## Federated EGA/LocalEGA login system

Central EGA contains a database of users, with IDs and passwords.

We have developed a solution based on [Apache Mina SSHD](https://mina.apache.org/sshd-project/)
to allow user authentication via
either a password or an RSA key against the CentralEGA database
itself. The user is locked within their home folder, which is done programmatically using [RootedFileSystem](https://github.com/apache/mina-sshd/blob/master/sshd-core/src/main/java/org/apache/sshd/common/file/root/RootedFileSystem.java).

The solution uses CentralEGA's user IDs but can also be extended to
use Elixir IDs (of which we strip the ``@elixir-europe.org`` suffix).

For local development/testing see instructions in [dev_utils](/dev_utils) folder.
There is an README file in the [dev_utils](/dev_utils) folder with sections for running the pipeline locally using Docker Compose.

The procedure is as follows. The inbox is started without any created
user. When a user wants to log into the inbox (actually, only ``sftp``
uploads are allowed), the code looks up the username in a local
cache, and, if not found, queries the CentralEGA REST endpoint. Upon
return, we store the user credentials in the local cache and create
the user's home directory. The user now gets logged in if the password
or public key authentication succeeds. Upon subsequent login attempts,
only the local cache is queried, until the user's credentials
expire. The cache has a default TTL of 5 minutes, and is wiped clean
upon reboot (as a cache should). Default TTL can be configured via ``CACHE_TTL`` env var.

The user's home directory is created when its credentials upon successful login.
Moreover, for each user, we detect when the file upload is completed and compute its
checksum. 

## S3 integration

Default storage back-end for the inbox is local file-system. But we also support S3 service as a back-end. It can be 
enabled using S3-related env-vars (see configuration details below).

If S3 is enabled, then files are still going to be stored locally, but after successful upload, they will going to be 
uploaded to the specified S3 back-end. With this approach local file-system plays role of so called "staging area", 
while S3 is the real final destination for the uploaded files.

If `LOGSTASH_HOST` or `LOGSTASH_PORT` is empty, Logstash logging will not be enabled.

In addition, environment variables can be used to configure log level for different packages. Package loggers can be configured using corresponding package names, for example, to turn of logs of Spring, one can set environment variable `LOGGING_LEVEL_ORG_SPRINGFRAMEWORK=OFF`, or to set Mina's own logs to debug: `LOGGING_LEVEL_SE_NBIS_LEGA_INBOX=DEBUG`, etc.
